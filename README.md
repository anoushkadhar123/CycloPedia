# CycloPedia
The CycloPedia is a compendium or reference book that offers summaries of information that are broad or specific to a given topic or profession.

Encyclopaedias are broken up into sections called articles or entries that are listed alphabetically by the article's name or by categories of themes, or else are hyperlinked and searchable.

We are all familiar with what a dictionary is and what it accomplishes. In this project, there is initially simply a search input on the webpage. 

When you enter any existing term and hit Enter, the meaning of the specific phrase is displayed.

If the sought term is present, the definition, example, synonyms, etc. are displayed with a slide animation; otherwise, the message "Can't find the meaning of......" is displayed.
